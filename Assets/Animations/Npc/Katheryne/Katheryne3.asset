  - Tell me... do you believe in the words of a child?
  - "This morning, a letter arrived\u2014no sender, no knock. Just a slip of paper
    left beneath the door. "
  - "The handwriting was shaky\u2026 small. A name at the bottom: Rika."
  - "She wrote that her mother had gone into the forest to gather herbs\u2026 and
    never came back."
  - "I\u2019ll be honest with you\u2014this isn\u2019t the kind of job that comes
    with coin or glory. There\u2019s no bounty posted, no reward promised. Just a
    child\u2019s plea."
  - "Still... something about that letter\u2014it stayed with me. Like her words
    were heavier than the paper they were written on."
  - And there are rumors, you know. Strange, unexplainable things in those woods
    lately.
  - "This time\u2026 it might be more than just a child\u2019s imagination."
