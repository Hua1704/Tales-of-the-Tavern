  dialogueLines:
  - 'Ah, welcome to the "Untold Tales" Tavern. You must be new around here. '
  - This is your first time?
  - This is the place where adventurers gather after long days of hunting monsters,
    unearthing ruins, or running from angry mobs.
  - "A little peace, a lot of stories, and sometimes\u2026 a new adventure."
  - "There\u2019s always someone in need... if you\u2019re still up for the adventure."
  - Tell me... do you believe in the words of a child?
  - This morning, a little girl named Rika came by, holding a wrinkled letter close
    to her chest.
  - "She said her mother went into the forest to search for herbs\u2026 but never
    returned."
  - "I\u2019ll be honest with you\u2014this request doesn\u2019t come with a proper
    reward. No gold, no bounty. Just... a plea."
  - Lately, strange things have been happening in those woods. More than just stories
    this time.
  - "Still, there was something in the Rika\u2019s eyes... something I couldn\u2019t
    ignore."
  - And there are rumors, you know. Strange, unexplainable things in those woods
    lately.
  - "This time\u2026 it might be more than just a child\u2019s imagination. "
  - "Thank you! Then it\u2019s time you met Rika for yourself."
  - See you again!
